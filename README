asbestos-avr8susb
=================

This is the asbestos-avr8susb, a ps3 exploit for Atmel avr8 devices without
USB support.

It's primarily targeted at loading asbestos, which is included in binary form.

The payload (stage1) will install an usb driver which will download stage2
from usb. Then, stage2 will netboot (dhcp + tftp). 

Refer to asbestos for further information.

http://git.marcansoft.com/?p=asbestos.git

It could be made to run anything else by replacing stage1 (in the first
device's descriptor in descriptor.h) and/or stage2 (in stage2.h)

Most atmegas do not have enough memory to fit stage2. To work that around,
there is support for streaming from an additional i2c AT24C512 or
compatible 24Cxx EEPROM.

I wrote a tool to program the EEPROM. It can be found in "tools/". If other
means are used to program it, make sure the first 16bit word in the eeprom is
the size of stage. Store stage2 next.

It should work, with builtin stage2, on:
- ATMega1280 (Arduino Mega)
... and maybe more. 

It should work, with an EEPROM:
- ATMega328P (Arduino UNO, Arduino Duemilanove)
- ATMega168 (Arduino Duemilanove, older Arduinos)
... and maybe more.

This software is not intended to enable piracy. This software is intended to
allow the use of third party operating systems and applications on the PS3.


Notes
-----
This software is based on psgroove-timwu, a port of psgroove to vusb.

This software includes parts of asbestos, written by Hector Martín (marcan).

This software includes the vusb library, written by Objective Development.

This software includes eeprom support functions from twitest.c, written by
Joerg Wunsch and Ruwan Jayanetti.


Cloning
-------
    git clone git://github.com/rvalles/asbestos-avr8susb


Configuring
-----------
Chip and board selection can usually be handled in the Makefile.
In particular, update the MCU, BOARD, and F_CPU lines.  Suggested values:

Arduino Mega
    MCU = atmega1280
    BOARD = ArduinoMega
    F_CLOCK = 16000000

Arduino Duemilanove (atmega168)
    MCU = atmega168
    BOARD = ArduinoDuemilanove
    F_CLOCK = 16000000

Arduino Duemilanove (atmega328p)
    MCU = atmega328p
    BOARD = ArduinoDuemilanove
    F_CLOCK = 16000000


Board-specific notes
--------------------
See README in subfolder for Boards corresponding to your particular board.


Building
--------
On Linux, use the AVR GCC toolchain (Debian/Ubuntu package: gcc-avr) and 
the AVR libc (Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo package: avr-libc).
On MacOS X, check http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/download.html
On Windows, WinAVR should do the trick.

    make clean
    make


Programming
-----------

To program, just edit the programming options section of the Makefile
to match your particular board programming setup. You will need avrdude
on your path. Then do:

    make program
    
For arduino users, you can get some hints as to how to configure the
programming options by checking what the arduino IDE does.

1. Open the arduino ide.
2. Import an example sketch.
3. Press GUI button to upload to your board while holding shift.
4. Check the output.

From the IDE's output you should be able to determine what port to use
and other useful information about configuring the options.


Using
-----
To use this exploit:
  
* Hard power cycle your PS3 (using the switch in back, or unplug it)
* Plug the dongle into your PS3.
* Press the PS3 power button, followed quickly by the eject button.

After a few seconds, the first LED on your dongle should light up.

After a few more seconds, the second LED will light up (or the LED
will just go off, if you only have one).  This means the exploit
worked!

By default, the exploit will netboot the PS3 (dhcp+tftp).

During stage1, the exploit will provide debug information through
the uart, at 57600bps.

Once stage2 is running, it'll provide debug information via ethernet
broadcast packets.

Refer to asbestos for further information.
